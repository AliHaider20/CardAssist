💳 CardAssist: Multi-Agent Credit Card Assistant using Semantic Kernel

CardAssist is a multi-agent AI assistant that leverages Semantic Kernel, OpenAI, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to perform intelligent credit card management tasks such as activation, deactivation, and natural language Q&A from a PDF-based user guide.
Designed to be modular and extensible, it enables conversational, grounded assistance for end users.

### 🔧 Core Components

#### 🔹 Embedding & Indexing

- Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for PDF chunk embedding  
- Embedded chunks are indexed using FAISS for similarity search  

#### 🔹 Semantic Kernel Plugins

```python
@kernel_function
async def activate_card(card_number: str) -> str:

💬 Sample Interactions

🔧 Activate Card

“Can you activate my credit card 1234-5678-9012-3456?”

💬 Response: Credit card 1234-5678-9012-3456 has been activated.

⸻

❌ Deactivate Card

“Please deactivate my card ending in 3456”

💬 Response: Credit card ending in 3456 has been successfully deactivated.

⸻

🧠 Ask a Question (RAG)

“Steps for First-time Registration for Corporate Accounts”

💬 Response: To register as a new user for a corporate account, follow these steps…
